## Getting Started
### Requirements:
  + Windows (**only support Windows**):
    + Visual Studio 2022 with essential C++, SDK Installation
    + CMake
    + Doxygen
### Building:
  + Windows (**only support Windows**):
    + Step 1: Clone [NCPP git repository](https://github.com/n-c0d3r/ncpp) from GitHub  
      ```batch
      git clone https://github.com/n-c0d3r/ncpp.git --recurse-submodules
      cd ncpp
      ```
      or
      ```batch
      git clone https://github.com/n-c0d3r/ncpp.git
      cd ncpp
      git submodule update --init --recursive
      ```
    + Step 2: Generate Visual Studio 2022 solution by running **generate_vs2022.bat**
    + Step 3: Navigate to **path/to/your/ncpp/build/vs2022**
    + Step 4: Open **npp.sln**
    + Step 5: Set **ncpp.samples.firt_sample** as startup project
    + Step 6: Run and enjoy!
